==============================

A model for calculating average global diets in nuclear winter and other catastrophes

# Run the model

### Using Colab (most users use this):
The interactive model runs off colab. It doesn't require any downloading or code, you just need to hit the right buttons as they show up. Here's a demo:

Open 'Food combinations - Charts.ipynb'

![step3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allfed/Nutrition-calculator-allfed/main/readme_content/step3.png)

Click 'Open in Colab'.

Select 'Authorize with github'.

![step5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allfed/Nutrition-calculator-allfed/main/readme_content/step5.png)

Select 'OK'.

![step6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allfed/Nutrition-calculator-allfed/main/readme_content/step6.png)

For the repository, select 'allfed/Nutrition-calculator-allfed' branch 'main', then click on the item labelled under Path, 'notebooks/Food combinations - Charts.ipynb'.

Now follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook. Run each line of the Jupyter notebook in succession to view results of the paper.

Please let me know if any of these steps go awry! (contact morgan [at] allfed [dot] info)
